# Creating a personalized movie score based on my historic rating patterns

## About the project
Before I watch a movie, I usually check out IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. Since IMDB displays the Metascore too, this quick round of research gives me 4 different datapoints on how different audiences rated the movie. 

### Data
I've been rating movies on IMDB for years. I exported this data (`ratings.csv`) and scraped Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes for the films that I rated. Therefore the final dataset has a 'Your Rating' column along with four columns used as features in the models
-'IMDB rating'
-'Metascore'
-'Rotten Tomatoes Audience Score'
-'Rotten Tomatoes Critics Score'
